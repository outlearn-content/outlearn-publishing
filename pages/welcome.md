# Welcome Amazing Teacher

That's what you are, after all &#x2014; a teacher.  Don't worry, it's a good thing!  The "noblest profession", as the saying goes.

These days, developers are in need of great teachers.  Too few in our growing ecosystem possess the unique talents to make these tough concepts seem approachable, and to cut through the cruft and teach us stuff that's immediately useful.

You have the necessary knowledge, experience, and communication skill, plus a desire to share what you know with developers.  And Outlearn has a great publishing platform for you, whether you are:

* an individual developer blogger with a passion for great technical writing and a desire to build your audience
* an open source project that needs to get the word out about how to take advantage of your software
* a company supporting great developer services, tools, or APIs that deserves an equally great training experience
* a hacker with awesome pro tips to share about your favorite platforms

In this learning path, you'll learn everything you need to know to simply and efficiently publish your material to Outlearn, publicly or for your private audience, and take advantage of the evolving learning features Outlearn offers to enrich your content and make it more engaging.

### Outlearn Modules and Packages

Modules are the basic unit of learning in Outlearn. We'll start with a simple _Hello World_ learning module, because...you know..._hello world_!

The _Hello World_ module will also introduce you to Outlearn Packages. They provide a flexible way to author full paths as well as complex modules.  We'll explore in plain terms how they work.

### Specs, beautiful full specs

Finally, provided in this path are the full specification docs for our authoring formats, for those who want to dig in on more advanced features.

Let's get started!
