# The Gritty Details

If you'd like to know more about the full specs and capabilities of Outlearn publishing formats, the next two modules provide the gritty details.  You can also find them at any time directly on Github ([OLM](https://github.com/outlearn-content/outlearn-olm-spec/blob/master/olm-spec.md) and [OLP](https://github.com/outlearn-content/outlearn-olp-spec/blob/master/olp-spec.md)), where we encourage you to leave feedback or issues directly in GitHub issues, so we can continue to evolve the formats to meet your needs.  We count on the creativity of great content authors to drive these formats forward.

Without further ado, on to the specs...
