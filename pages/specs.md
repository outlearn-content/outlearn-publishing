# The Gritty Details

The previous Module should have gotten you well on your way to getting awesome content out there. If you are ready to dive into the next level of Outlearn Kung Fu, check out the next Module. You'll learn more about Outlearn Organizations, their relationship to GitHub organizations, and how to assemble Paths from Modules that live in separate repos.

If you'd like to know more about the full specs and capabilities of Outlearn publishing formats, feel free to skip the Outlearn Kung Fu and explore the two modules after, which provide the gritty details.  You can also find them at any time directly on Github ([OLM](https://github.com/outlearn-content/outlearn-olm-spec/blob/master/olm-spec.md) and [OLP](https://github.com/outlearn-content/outlearn-olp-spec/blob/master/olp-spec.md)), where we encourage you to leave feedback or issues directly in GitHub issues, so we can continue to evolve the formats to meet your needs.  We count on the creativity of great content authors to drive these formats forward.

Without further ado, on to the specs...
