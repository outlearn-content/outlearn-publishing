# Welcome to Outlearn

Different people learn differently, we get it. Some want to jump right in and figure things out as they go along. Others want to get a quick overview before starting to use a new tool. If you are in the second camp, this path will highlight how to get most out of Outlearn. And if you already jumped in and are coming back to learn more about how the platform works, we're here for you too.

Outlearn features authors and content that make tough concepts seem approachable, cut through the cruft, and teach stuff that's immediately useful.
